# v3.0.0

[COMPATIBILITY] Removed callback, have_instance_method and have_class_method
matchers. They don't lead to a good TDD since you should test they behavior
and not wether they exist or not.

[COMPATIBILITY] Removed the get_instance_of from before_assert. So we should
target only rspec versions that supports subjects.

This will also remove a feature that automatically gets the instance from the
@spec binding. Previously, when we are doing this:

   describe Product
     before(:each){ @product = Product.new(:tangible => true) }
     should_validate_presence_of :size
   end

It was validating the @product instance variable. However this too magic. The
right way to do that (with subjects) is:

   describe Product
     subject{ Product.new(:tangible => true) }
     should_validate_presence_of :size
   end

# v2.x

Added associations, allow_mass_assignment, allow_values_for, have_db_column,
have_index, have_named_scope, have_readonly_attributes, validate_acceptance_of,
validate_associate, validate_confirmation_of, validate_exclusion_of,
validate_inclusion_of, validate_length_of, validate_numericality_of,
validate_presence_of and validate_uniqueness_of matchers.
