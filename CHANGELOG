# v3.0.0

* Removed the get_instance_of from before_assert. So we should target only rspec
  versions that supports subjects.

  This will also remove a feature that automatically gets the instance from the
  @spec binding. Previously, when we are doing this:

     describe Product
       before(:each){ @product = Product.new(:tangible => true) }
       should_validate_presence_of :size
     end

  It was validating the @product instance variable. However this too magic. The
  right way to do that (with the addiction of subject) is:

     describe Product
       subject{ Product.new(:tangible => true) }
       should_validate_presence_of :size
     end

* Added validate_uniquess_of matcher
* Added define_model for tests
* Added validate_numericality_of matcher
* Added validate_presence_of matcher
* Added validate_length_of matcher
